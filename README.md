# Huffman Encoding Desktop Application

This project implements a **lossless text compression** algorithm using **Huffman Encoding**. Built using **C++** and the **Qt framework**, the application allows users to encode and decode text files, reducing the size of the text while maintaining its integrity.

## Introduction

Huffman Encoding is a widely used compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This project demonstrates the power of Huffman Encoding by providing a graphical desktop application that can encode and decode any text file using this algorithm.

## Features

- **Lossless Compression**: Compress text without losing any information.
- **Encode/Decode Support**: Compress text into binary form using Huffman Encoding and then decode it back to its original form.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Built using the Qt framework for a user-friendly interface.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: View the compressed result and file size reduction immediately.
